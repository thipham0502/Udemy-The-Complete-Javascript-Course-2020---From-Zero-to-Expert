Scope: Space or environment in which a certain variable is declared 
(variable environment in case of functions). These is global scope, function scope, and block scope.

Scope of a variable: Region of our code where a certain variable can be accessed.

/* 3 types of scope */
- Global scope:
    + Outside of any function or block
    + Variables are accessible everywhere (global variable)
    
- Function scope ~ Local scope:
    + Variables are accessible only inside function, NOT outside
    + Also called
    Ex:
        function calcAge(birthYear) {
            const now = 2020;
            const age = now - birthYear;
            return age;
        }
        console.log(now); //ReferenceError

- Block scope (ES6):
    + Variables are accessible only inside block (if, loops, ...)
    + ONLY applies to 'let' and 'const' declaration
    Ex:
        if (age < 18) {
            const adult = false;
        }
        console.log(adult); //ReferenceError

    + If 'use strict' mode, then functions are also block scoped
